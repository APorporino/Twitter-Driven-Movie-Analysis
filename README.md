This project was completed as the final project for the course COMP598 - Intro To Data Science at McGill University in Fall of 2021. It was completed in a team of 3.

This project analyzed 1000 tweets from Twitter related to the movie "King Richard" to understand the reception and sentiment of this film.

We collected the data, conducted an open coding to develop a typology of categories. We then manually annotated the tweets according to typology and sentiment (posittve/neutral/negative) and analyzed this data. The top ten words in each category based on TF-IDF was also caclulated and analyzed.
